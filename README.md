# APParent

This is the first major project my team and I completed for Coding Bootcamp. A web application geared towards usefulness to Parents that utilizes various techniques such as AJAX/API calling and MaterializeCSS. The idea here was to exhibit proficiency with making AJAX calls and then taking the resulting information and displaying it in a useful way.


Three different API's were used: "BetterDocs" for Pediatric Doctors, "Walmart" for shopping, and "Eventful" for family events. 

The BetterDocs API call was configured so that users could search for pediatric doctors based on their location and insurance coverage. The Walmart API call was configured so that a user could search by item name and the Evenful API call was configured so that the user would put in a keyword (such as family or fair) and the particular city they're looking for.

All results are rendered into a table format using JQuery.
